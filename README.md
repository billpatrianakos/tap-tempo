# Tap Tempo

> A simple web app to tap out a tempo using your mouse or keyboard. Figure out the BPMs of your favorite songs

Tap Tempo lets you tap out a tempo using your computer's mouse, trackpad, or keyboard (or just tap your phone if you're using a mobile device or touch screen). Ever had a song idea in your head and wanted to figure out the beats per minute? Or maybe you were curious about the tempo of a song you like. Tap Tempo lets you tap it out. Just tap, click, or press to the beat and you'll be shown the tempo you're tapping at in Beats Per Minute.
