# Fractionless Ignores
#
# There are 4 things we generally ignore
# in all projects:
#
# - Dependancies: These should be installed
#   through a package manager.
# - System files: No one needs a copy of your
#   .DS_Store file
# - Environment files: Never force your users
#   to adhere too strictly to a certain environment.
# - Build results: Builds should be reproduceable
#   and distributed outside of the repo
